**CLAUDE CODE · POSTTOOLUSE HOOK · SONNET 5.5**

A hook swaps large tool outputs for a short fact list written by a cheaper model.
Over 7 days the main model read 186,653 tokens of tool output instead of
1,848,179.

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **−89.9%** | tool-output tokens in the main context |
| **181** | large outputs compressed in 7 days |
| **$0.040** | per Sonnet 5.5 call, list price |

## 7-DAY EVENT LOG · CLAUDE CODE + CODEX

### Where the tokens come from

Discovery results are the heavy part: code search, code-graph search, docs, logs
and web results. Every tool result stays in the conversation, so the main model
reads it again on every later turn.

| Source | Raw | Sent | Cut |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Code-graph search (MCP) | 634,667 | 104,566 | −83.5% |
| Code search hits (MCP) | 625,134 | 35,843 | −94.3% |
| Docs search + fetch (MCP) | 214,474 | 5,876 | −97.3% |
| Web search results | 154,106 | 33,949 | −78.0% |
| Test and build logs | 109,944 | 2,007 | −98.2% |
| grep / rg | 89,558 | 3,262 | −96.4% |
| git log / status | 20,296 | 1,150 | −94.3% |
| **Total** | **1,848,179** | **186,653** | **−89.9%** |

Token counts are o200k estimates of the tool payload only. The largest single raw
output that week was one grep of 55,348 tokens.

## MECHANISM

### How the hook works

Claude Code runs your own command at fixed points of the agent loop
(`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop` and
more). The command gets the event as JSON on stdin and can answer with JSON on
stdout. Two answers can change what the model reads:

| Before the tool runs | After the tool runs |
| --- | --- |
| **PreToolUse → `updatedInput`** | **PostToolUse → `updatedToolOutput`** |
| Rewrites the tool arguments. Use it to wrap a shell command in a script that compresses its output. This also works in Codex. | Replaces what Claude sees. The value must keep the tool's output shape, for example `stdout`, `stderr`, `interrupted` and `isImage` for Bash. |

## SETUP · ABOUT 5 MINUTES

### Add it to Claude Code

**1. Save the hook script**

Save it as `~/.claude/hooks/compress_hook.py`. It uses only the Python standard
library and the `claude` CLI you already have.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Claude Code PostToolUse hook: shrink large tool outputs with Claude Sonnet 5.5
before the main model reads them. Fails open: any problem keeps the original."""
import hashlib
import json
import os
import pathlib
import re
import subprocess
import sys

MIN_TOKENS = 3500            # smaller outputs stay raw
MAX_SOURCE_CHARS = 200_000   # bigger outputs stay raw (cost cap)
MAX_SUMMARY_TOKENS = 1800    # replacement budget
MIN_SAVING = 0.30            # keep raw unless we save at least 30 %
ARCHIVE = pathlib.Path.home() / ".cache/compress-hook/raw"
# Only discovery / log commands. Exact reads (cat, sed, head), diffs and edits stay
BASH_ALLOW = re.compile(r"^\s*(rg|grep|find|fd|git (log|status)|pytest|jest|vitest|"
                        r"npm (run )?(test|build|lint)|kubectl logs|docker logs)\b")
SECRET = re.compile(r"(api[_-]?key|secret|password|bearer |BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY)
PROMPT = ("You compress captured tool output for a coding assistant. Return 1-6 fact
          "0-3 unknowns, at most 350 words. Keep exact file names, line numbers, ide
          "and error messages. State only what the text supports. Never invent paths
```

> **Note:** the printed PDF cuts this listing off after `import sys` and shows only
> a fragment of the constants block — the code pane overflowed the page in the
> export. The lines shown above are everything the PDF contains. The full script
> lives in the original artifact.

**2. Register it in settings**

Add this to `~/.claude/settings.json`. The matcher is a regular expression: Bash
plus every MCP tool.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "^(Bash|mcp.*)$",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/compress_hook.py",
            "timeout": 120
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**3. Check it**

Open `/hooks` in a new session to confirm the entry, then ask Claude to run a
wide `rg`. A compressed result starts with
`[compressed by Sonnet 5.5: ~6074 → ~730 tokens; full output: …]`. That line is
from a real test run, which took 8.2 s.

## BLIND TEST · 16 REAL OUTPUTS · OPUS 5.5 JUDGE

### Choosing the reader model

The judge ranked each summary against its raw source for faithfulness (no
invented facts) and coverage (no dropped facts). Ranks compare models inside the
same judge round only.

| Reader model | Round | Rank ↓ | Faithful /5 | Coverage /5 | P50 | Cost/call |
| --- | :---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Sonnet 5.5 · medium | 1 | 2.00 | 4.62 | 4.88 | 7.3 s | $0.040\* |
| Sonnet 5.5 · low | 1 | 2.25 | 4.50 | — | 6.1 s | $0.060 |
| Sonnet 5 · low | 1 | 2.81 | 4.75 | 4.38 | 9.8 s | $0.068 |
| Haiku 4.5 | 1 | 5.88 | 2.94 | — | — | — |
| Sonnet 5.5 · medium | 2–3 | 1.50–1.62 | 4.44 | 4.94–5.00 | 7.3 s | $0.040\* |
| GPT-5.6 Sol · low | 2–3 | 2.94–3.75 | 4.69–4.81 | — | — | $0.070 |
| GPT-5.6 Luna · low | 2–3 | 4.69–5.44 | 4.56–4.62 | 3.00–3.31 | 8.3 s | $0.0032 |
| GPT-6 Luna · low | 2–3 | 5.50 | 4.31 | 2.62 | — | — |

Costs are API list-price equivalents. \* With the 5-minute cache setting below;
$0.059 without it. Other Sonnet rows were measured before that change.

- Use Sonnet 5.5 at `effort medium`. Its default is `high`, so set it. `low` is
  close and a little faster.
- **Do not use Haiku 4.5 here.** It invented file names and citations, and a JSON
  validator passed all 16 of those answers.
- Sonnet 5.5 costs $2 / $10 per MTok, half of Opus 5.5 at $4 / $20, and it reads
  each output once.
- Set `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL=5m` for the helper. On a subscription login,
  `claude -p` writes each prompt to a 1-hour cache at 2× the input price. A
  one-shot summary never reads it back. The change cut the cost per call by 32%
  (16 of 16 outputs still valid).
- Keep the helper inert: `--tools ""`, `--strict-mcp-config`,
  `--setting-sources ""`, `--no-session-persistence` and `disableAllHooks`. It
  can only read and answer, and it cannot start the hook again.

---

## SAFETY

### What never gets compressed

- Outputs under 3,500 tokens. Summarizing them saves too little.
- Exact reads: `Read`, `cat`, `sed -n`, code snippets. The model needs the real
  source to edit it.
- Git patches and diffs, failed or interrupted commands, and any output with
  `stderr`.
- Anything that looks like a credential. It stays raw and is never sent to a
  second model.
- A summary over 1,800 tokens or less than 30% smaller. The original goes
  through.

Every raw output is archived, and its path is in the summary header, so Claude
can open the full text when a fact is missing. The input to the helper is marked
as untrusted data, which blocks prompt injection from a web page or a log line.
On any error the hook exits silently and Claude sees the original.

---

## OPENAI CODEX

### Same idea with GPT-6 Astra and Luna

The same pipeline serves Codex with GPT-6 Astra as the main model. A `PreToolUse`
hook rewrites eligible shell commands to run through a wrapper that compresses
the output, and a small stdio proxy in front of each MCP server compresses search
results before Codex sees them. Web results go through an explicit bridge.

- GPT-5.6 Luna is about 12× cheaper per call than Sonnet 5.5. It did not invent
  facts, but it dropped more of them (coverage 3.0 against 5.0).
- One extra re-read of a 14k-token raw output by the Opus main model costs about
  what Luna saves per call. That is why Sonnet 5.5 stays first.
- GPT-5.6 Sol on low is the backup. It runs only when the first helper hits a
  capacity limit, quota or timeout.

> In Claude Code, prefer `PostToolUse`. Codex needs
> `permissionDecision: "allow"` next to `updatedInput`, so wrapped commands skip
> the permission prompt. `PostToolUse` changes only what the model reads.

---

## ACCOUNTING

### What the 90% means

The 89.9% is the drop in tool-output tokens that reach the main model. The
helpers still read the raw text: 3.17M helper tokens that week, most of it on an
earlier Cursor helper. Counted in raw tokens, total processing went up.

The saving is where those tokens land. A tool result stays in the conversation,
so the main model reads it again on every turn. If the 55,348-token grep stays
for 30 turns, Opus 5.5 re-reads 1.66M cached tokens (about $0.33 at $0.20 per
MTok of cache reads), and the grep keeps using context room until compaction. One
Sonnet 5.5 pass over it costs about $0.15, and the 1,800-token summary is what
stays.

## Transcription notes

These notes describe only how this archival copy differs in *presentation* from
the original artifact. No substantive claim has been added or removed.

- **Source:** transcribed from a PDF export of the artifact
  (`~/Downloads/ClaudeContextDiet.pdf`, 7 pages, generated 2026-10-02 19:25).
- **Hook script is incomplete in the export.** The PDF's code pane overflows the
  page: the listing ends at `import sys`, and the constants block
  (`MIN_TOKENS` … `PROMPT`) is clipped mid-line (`SECRET = re.compile(...)` is
  missing its closing quote and paren). The lines reproduced above are exactly
  what the export contains. The complete script is only in the original artifact.
- **Settings JSON and shell flags.** The PDF rendered the hook matcher as
  `"^(Bash|mcp"%.*)$"` (an export artifact); it is shown here as `"^(Bash|mcp.*)$"`.
  The helper flags were rendered as `"&tools ""`, `"&strict-mcp-config`, etc.; the
  leading `"&` is a dropped-hyphen export artifact for `--`, so they are shown
  here as `--tools ""`, `--strict-mcp-config`, and so on.
- **Diagrams.** The mechanism figure and the "where the tokens come from" flow
  are reproduced as an ASCII sketch and tables rather than vector art.
- **Typos preserved in spirit.** The PDF's "ide" (for `identifiers`) inside the
  clipped `PROMPT` string is retained as printed, since that line cannot be
  reconstructed with confidence.
